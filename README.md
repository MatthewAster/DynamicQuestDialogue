This is a dynamic quest and dialogue system. The full projects is available with a demonstration and blueprints used 
primarily for UI elements and dialogue trees. Dialogue accounts for player skills, quest progress, and multiple options. 

Quests can be created with a variety of objective types that include kill, fetch, reach location, and talk. Each objective
can have multiple targets, i.e. killing 10 enemies or collecting 10 objects. Quests can be created with objectives needing to
be completed in order or in any order. Quest objects can appear on quest accept or exist seperately. 

Quest progress is tracked on the sidebar and details for each quest are written in a player journal. Clicking on a quest
displays a description.
